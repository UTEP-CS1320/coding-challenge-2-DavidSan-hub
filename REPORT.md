### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

In making my Systolic and Diastolic pressure program, I first followed the first statement created in the orignal program. By doing so, I was able to create the a fully working program that emcompassed all the requirements from each range given for the blood pressures. 
Originally, I had ten if statements that encompassed the ranges given. To ensure that the program would output "error" when s < d I created an if else statement that emcompassed the entire program. This then gave me 11 if statements. 
By examining the program I tried to think of ways to shorten the code and realized I could combine the s statements and the d statements using || with parenthesis. Through this I essentially cut my if statements in half, which now sits at six if statements. Likewise, I found problems with executing correct printed statements and decided to reverse the code, where it searches the largest numbers and gets smaller per statement giving the right outputs. 
Though this program only uses six if statements, I was unsure of how to use case statements which would reduce the number of ifs I used and could streamline the portion of the program that is within the first if statement.
